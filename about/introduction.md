## Introduction

![Costa Rica](/images/globe.png){: .pull-right .txt-img } Costa Rica, a small country of 4.6 million residents and 51,100 km2 located in Central America, is gearing up to face the challenges that arise as it becomes a member of the Pacific Alliance through the subscription of regional agreement with Mexico, Chile, Colombia, USA, Panama and Peru. This Alliance shall create synergies among these countries that will lead to becoming chain competitors/partners in order to offer goods and services in the entire Asian-Pacific area and it’s emerging economies (ASIAN). For this, Costa Rica must initiate without delay pro-active initiatives that will substantially improve its infrastruc-ture on all levels: roads, ports, airports, railways, etc.

This country is a Latin American stronghold with high levels of human development in education and health, with plans that have prospered and been maintained for nearly 50 years.  It now has the great challenge of making long-term decisions that will allow it to generate better and well remunerated jobs, tangible improvements in education and health, maintenance and improvement of its general population welfare levels. The insertion of Costa Rica into the Pacific Alliance will doubtless be one more tool, among others, that will help this small country to steer along the correct route in order to become a developed country within the next 30 years.

Sub-development can become a permanent condition as well as mediocrity, minds become slow and heavy when a country and its context do not innovate, do not develop and the fundamental changes do not transcend and are not executed due to lack of innovating and developing policies and only those that fit the minds of populist politicians with little vision take place. Progress and development are with-out doubt the mission and vision of this initiative but always hand-in-hand with their social contribution, this being their maximum goal, and of course hand-in-hand with environmental sustainability.

That is why, Pacific Tree S.A., a promoting and coordinating company of the initiative denominated Smart City Punta Perla Pacifico, wishes to layout its idea and vision which has begun as a dream, but that Costa Rica can bring to life. We oppose and we refuse to think that Costa Rica has to remain in that sub-development lethargy for another 50 years, condemning future generations to a lack of progress opportunities. This being so, Punta Perla Pacífico is precisely about that; it is about promoting a substantial well-planned change with traceable long-term goals.

## Relevant Infraestructure

![Costa Rica](/images/costa-rica-intro.png){: .pull-left .txt-img } Costa Rica is a country with high indexes of schooling, bilingualism, high-level technical and professional schools in the fields of engineering, medicine, computer science and IT, as well as being considered a tour-ism and ecological destination par excellence in Latin America. The Province of Puntarenas is joined together among other cantons by the three main cantons: Puntarenas  Center, Esparza and Miramar. These include a population of nearly 200,000 residents and this area, rich in lands with a flat topography for agricultural production and its Gulf of Nicoya, once a buoyant fishing zone, for more than 60 years were generators of wealth and employment, activities that no longer allow the needs demanded by the residents to be satisfied. However, it is area with an impressive potential, due to its strategic geographical location, its tourism potential without paragon being close to the largest beach of the Pacific and next to a long strip of wetlands and mangroves of exuberant natural beauty with an exit to the sea and towards the lovely islands of the Gulf of Nicoya. It is also located at only 75 kms by road from the capital city of Costa Rica, San Jose, and soon, one and a half hours away to the north to the best tourism area and beaches of the province of Guanacaste.

Punta Perla Pacífico would be located at the center of those three cantons, within an area that includes the small settlements of Pitaya and Chomes.  Its strategic location is highlighted since it is also surrounded by the three main ports of the Costa Rican Pacific shore: Caldera which is the grain port, the Cruiser Port of Puntarenas and the Sugar port of Punta Morales at the center of the Americas. Punta Perla Pacífico contemplates the development of a Smart City on a land extension of 5,600 hectares, which can be expanded up to 7,000 hectares.

## General Context

![Costa Rica](/images/project-map.png){: .pull-right .txt-img }The following would be established here: a mega manufacturing indus-trial zone, a trade center of Asian products, a large IT center that could operate as a Hub or core telecommunications center, in coordination with the three time zones of the USA and attractive for the telematic and communication operations that American companies operate today in centers in Southeast Asia and India with the disadvantage of the great time table difference with the USA, a convention center, a sports stadium with a sports center, a hospital and health center, school, high-school and university educational centers, residential compounds, shopping centers, a country club with a golf course, a theme park, recreational areas, hotel and casino center, Government offices, Justice Courts, firemen and police force, parks, roundabouts and avenues, etc.   All of this would exist under an integrated compound of “clusters” of smart communication systems in optic fiber, where one will only use self-sustainable transportation and energy support systems, using resources of renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources.

One would also think about locating a new international cargo airport that Costa Rica needs there, within a 500 hectare area, since these are flat topography lands, at a price per m2 well below those compared with other areas of the country that are currently being studied. Because they are flat lands, the cost of earth movements is low and, what is most important, there are no obstacles for natural approximation and take-off procedures, with the best location from the aeronautical point of view. The new mega port terminal of the Pacific could be located only 15 kms away in a maritime zone with special natural characteristics of draught and depth of 15 meters, where ships with a capacity of up to 12 thou-sand containers of the Panamax and Post Panamax type dimension ships, will be able to dock. With this, high aggregate value synergies would be established for merchandise trade through the Panama Canal and with the future Caribbean terminal port of Moin, of the Province of Limon, with a proposal currently under study that intends to join both coasts through a railway line, benefiting all the processes of the logistic chain of foreign trade of Costa Rica.

The city Punta Perla Pacífico would be connected through a new railway line and a modern train from and to the city of San Jose, so that the people who work there but do not live there, will be able to go from one place to the other in only 45 minutes. On the other hand, this project intends to decongest and relieve the great vehicle load, pollution issues and the great residential pressure of the Great Metropolitan Area, offeringto the younger generations both Costa Rican as well as foreigners, - through incentives and mechanisms of the Immigration policy of Costa Rica, derived from the Free Trade Agreements it has signed with various countries-, the possibility of developing and advancing in a non-polluted environment in contact with the Pacific Ocean, allowing them to live, work and study in the coastal zone, and with the real possibility of having their own house through integral financing plans.

This ambitious project would see its full peak at the end of 25 years.  Pacific Tree S.A., through this initiative-proposal wishes to invite Mega Developers, Development and Commercial Banks and International Investors to invest in this proposal, funding the next stage of our Con-ceptual Plan, which would be performing a Business Plan and an Envi-ronmental Incidence Study, based on a pre-feasibility economic study with the intention that this proposal may be qualified with the Declarationof National Interest and Private Initiative by the Government of Costa Rica.The funds invested in the mentioned studies would be reimbursablewhen the project enters its development stage.
