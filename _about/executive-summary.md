<h2>1.    Project description</h2><p>Punta Perla Pacífico refers to the development of a Smart City in an area of 5,600 to 7,000 hectares, which will be purchased by a group of developers and investors. The following infrastructure will be developed in a progressive manner:</p><p>1)   <strong> Development of an Industrial & Technological  Park Zone (IPZ)</strong>, in several phases, which includes a mega industrial area for manufacturing and services, a shopping ,distribition and large storage area for Asian products, a technological park which includes an IT,IOT, IDI and Big Data center which could function as a telecom hub in coordination with the USA´s three different time zones and as an attraction of call center operations which currently operate in Southeast Asia; at its premises: a convention center; a stadium with a sports center; a medical hub with a hospital and mixed health services; a school, high school and university centers; housing complexes with options for high income as well as low-income families; shopping centers; country club with golf course; theme park and cable car; entertainment areas, hotels and casinos; government offices; courts of justice, fire and police stations; parks, boulevards, avenues, etc.  All this with an integrated fiber optics Smart communication and operational  system, where all transportation services will be ecological and enviaronmentally sustainable, using renewable sources of energy.</p><p>2)    Location of Costa Rica´s new Cargo international airport - which it needs by 2025 - within an area of 300 hectares.  These lands will be negotiated by the development group, under a public-private alliance scheme with the Government.  Since the land is flat, and the price per meter squared is lower than in other areas being considered for this project, the cost of land movement is also low and there are no aerial obstructions for the landing and takeoff of aircraft.</p><p>3) At an advaced stage,the Location of the new ,mega Pacific port terminal for containers from Asia Pacific, South Pacific and North America, cargo and commercial shipping and liquid natural gas processing, import and export(LNG), which will be located only 15km away from the Garabito thermal generation plant in a maritime area with special natural characteristics for fretwork with a depth of 15 meters, where vessels of up to 12,000 Panamax and Post Panamax containers and vessels could dock. </p><p>4)    Establishment of a high level educational campus for technological transfer in various disciplines.  The campus will offer a variety of facilities and services which will promote research, innovation, technological transfer, development and education in strategic theme areas, through collaborative work between public and private universities local and international, businesses, NGOs and government, under the concept of “E<strong>ducational Cluster</strong>”.  This way, Punta Perla Pacífico will become a high level educational and formative engine in novelty specialty areas such as energy and efficiency, where options for high performance and low environmental impact energy can be developed, and where the use of renewable energies, telematics, medical components , aerospace technology and robotics, among others, can be optimized.</p><p>A dual education and work program will be put in place to facilitate and  to promote the establishment of new manufacturing and service industries.</p><p>The development  of this Smart City will help decongest the Great Metropolitan Area (GAM and GAMA in Spanish) of traffic, air pollution and housing pressure and restrictions, land prices will also be lower, offering "milenials" , "Z  generation" and future generations of  Costa Ricans as well as foreigners – through the incentives and migratory policies which are already in place through Costa Rica´s Free Trade Agreements with various countries and the aforementioned Pacific Alliance –  could embrace good opportunities for progress and development in an environment free of pollution and traffic facing the beauty of the Pacific Ocean, allowing them to live, work, study and entertain in the coastal area and with a real possibility to own a smart apartment or smart house through integrated financing options with the national banking system.</p><p>With these opportunities, high added-value synergies can be established through the exchange of merchandise across the Panama Canal and with the future Mega Terminal Port in Moin, in the province of Limon on the Caribbean coast, and through a current initiative which proposes to unite both coasts  by a railroad network or "Dry Channel" in the northern part of the country benefitting all the logistics for Costa Rica´s exterior commerce.</p><p>In this way, Punta Perla Pacífico Smart City would be also connected through a new railroad and a modern electric train system to and from the city of San Jose, so people could commute for work or pleasure with a short 45-minute train ride from point to point.</p><p>This ambitious Project would be fully completed within 27 years of its starting date.  For this reason, for this initiative, Pacific Tree S.A. would like to work with the Government of Costa Rica in a private-public Alliance, and would like to invite development companies, development and commercial Banks, and national and international investors to invest in this opportunity, financing the following phase after the Conceptual Plan which has already been completed.  The next phase includes the preliminary study phase, with a DD study, a pre-feasibility financial, social and environmental  study and a pre-master plan in order to go on to advanced study pahse  of a Business Plan, a Master Plan and the Environmental Impact Study, with the objective of getting a Declaratory of National Interest under the Private Initiative Law,and the approval of all  required permits granted by the local and national authorities.</p><h2>2.    Expected results</h2><p>Punta Perla Pacífico Smart City  will be fully planned right from its beginning and will represent an opportunity to develop and alleviate an area of Costa Rica which currently lives in poverty as it has been socioeconomically depressed for many years.  This will be achieved through the establishment of a mutimodal  smart city based on development poles of infrastructure management, commerce, industry, services, education, health, recreation and the following strategic programs:</p><p>a)    Social Investment Program: Public Universities, the National Learning Institute (INA in Spanish), and private Universities, as well as professional technological  and scientific colleges will be invited to take part in this city by having their campuses, under specific development agreements.  For the public sector, we will propose a scheme where the developer supplies the land and infrastructure for such campuses.  There will be an emphasis on the development of highly qualified human capital, and dual education programs at various levels, as a basis for offering the appropriate conditions to those companies who wish to invest and establish their operations and facilities there; as well as attracting already-formed human capital from the Central Valley and  abroad.</p><p>b)    Scientific Development and Transfer Program: There will be a technological center with service and infrastructure facilities to manage (IDI) research, development and innovation in specific relevant areas such as aerospace, atmospheric and climate research, robotics, biology, pharmaceuticals, medicine, fotonics, environment and energy, amongst others.  Where national and international private and public education centers and NGOs can participate in a collaborative way and carry out technological transfers.</p><p>c)    Transportation Program: With the objective of improving public transportation to the Pacific coast and decongesting the Great Metropolitan Area of traffic, parallel to an extension of Route 27 by the current administrator, the possibility of a new railroad network with a modern electric train towards the  south basin of the Virilla River, which implies an improvement of the right of way of the current train route along with improvements to infrastructure, especially new bridges and tunnels.</p><p>d)    Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program: The land where the Project will take place is located in one of Costa Rica´s areas with the most year-round solar radiation; there is large potential for generating electric power through solar energy.  For this reason, there will be a solar photovoltaic park which will interact with the whole development: streets, avenues, houses, buildings, boulevards and parks, among others. Other options for renewable energy such as wind, algae and biomass will also be incorporated in the development.</p><p>e)    Environmental and Social Responsibility Program: Punta Perla Pacífico will contribute to make Costa Rica carbon neutral in the near future, especially because of the mandatory and binding character of the measures which countries need to subscribe to by 2021 in order to reduce carbon emissions, so they can be implemented and monitored systematically.  This initiative will support its inclusion in the OECD and the Pacific Alliance.  The development is conceived as a Smart City right from the start and it will be 100% environmentally sustainable.</p><p>f)     Technology and Industry Program: As mentioned above ,the Development of a technological and manufacturing park, will also provide the advantages that the Free Trade Law facilitates, where the appropriate conditions for infrastructure and human capital are created, with lower installation, operation and maintenance costs, fringe benefits reductions and tax incentives,so new industry can settle in and others will move to the Pacific coast.  It includes financing options for housing for the industry workers who will need to leave their houses in the Central Valley to move in this coastal area.</p><p>g)    Residential and Housing Program: Incentives and opportunities to attract younger and future generations to live, study, work and have fun in the Punta Perla Pacífico Smart City, allowing for decongestion of the GAM.  Additionally, we foresee a plan to develop low-cost housing, thus integrating under-priviledged communities into the Smart City through programs of self-building of houses and job creation, in coordination with the appropriate public agencies which are dedicated to social housing, as well as with the Ministry of Labor.</p><p>h)   Tourism Program: A first class Hotel zone will be developed, which will include entertainment and attraction areas, a Theme Park showcasing the culture, art and history of Costa Rica as well as fun ridesand and fuana exhibitions. We are also contemplating a plan to manage, maintain and preserve the mangroves as a low-impact tourist attraction and to visit by ferry boat the city of Puntarenas  and the beuatiful isles of the Gulf of Nicoya. At an advance stage will also be a cable car to and from the Montes de Oro de Miramar Mountains, facing the fabulous view of the Gulf of Nicoya.</p><p>i)     Institutional Program: Facilities for the gradual establishment of public institutions, so they can have  and run their offices there and move some of their operations to the Pacific Coast by having their own buildings, in order to save money by no longer renting offices in the GAM (Great Metro) area.</p><h2>3.    Project Reach at an Infrastructure Level</h2><p>The infrastructure work is foreseen as a systemic integrator which will foster the link between the various population groups and different entities or disciplinary specialties (work areas or economic, administrative or recreational activities).  As such, the idea is to contribute to define area scales (from the regional scale to the neighborhood scale). </p><p>Within the integrating formula of the concept of infrastructure, we must consider the zoning of collective activity areas such as sports centers, schools and universities, administrative buildings, internal collective transportation systems, as well as areas for certain activities and manufacturing. </p><p>In the case of Punta Perla Pacífico Smart City, we must work together with the local authorities (municipalities) to define a Regulatory Zoning Plan (RZP) for the urban development of the Project.</p><p>For this reason, we will determine gradual development phases which will allow for social, environmental and economic planning of the infrastructure.</p><p>From an aeronautical perspective, the privileged location for an international cargo airport to closely work and operate with the IPZ, it will allow the establishment of an urban element which will predominate throughout the whole development; this will generate multiple activities and will demand for a considerable amount of urban infrastructure. </p><p>With the purpose of maintaining the social and cultural link, we believe the recovery and improvement of the existing road network within the lands to be developed is crucial for maintaining a referential urban structure with a historical and cultural background.</p><p>In addition, we will plan for an extension of the current railroad network form San Jose to Puntarenas and vice versa, with the aim of retaining an alternative transportation system which will support the industry,  improve cargo and the transportation of people.</p><p>There are natural barriers, such as rivers, mangroves, wildlife protection areas, existing agro production areas (which will need to stay for a while), and topographical barriers, which will need to be considered in an analysis of costs and opportunities within the initial phases.  </p>
