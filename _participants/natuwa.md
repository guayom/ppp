description: "<h3><i><i><i>MACAW SANCTUARY NATUWA</i></i></i><br></h3><p><i><i><i>The
  Macaw Sanctuary, Natuwa, has the expertise for more than 15 years  in the provision
  of a place that provides refuge and protection to the <strong>wild animals </strong>that
  have been victimized by human actions, such as <strong>hunting</strong>, <strong>removal
  from their environments </strong>and the <strong>desforestation</strong>. </i></i></i><i><i><i>Many
  of these homeless animals find the attention they need at the Macaw Sanctuary Natuwa
  to be able to live in captivity with dignity or find the possibility to return to
  their natural environments. Theretofore Natuwa (aramacao bird sactuary) is working
  with Punta Perla Pacifico in the development of a conceptual plan of our Theme Park
  with regards to animal protection, careing, reproduction and exihibition of Costa
  Rica's native species.  </i></i></i></p>"
