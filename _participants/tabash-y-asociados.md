  activities such as agriculture, livestock, agro-industry, industry, commerce and
  services and a large variety of entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized companies,

  will concentrate on the first three fundamental parts of this project: &gt; a) the
  first task will be to obtain resources for the preliminary studies. &gt;  b) the
  second will be to gather a group of innovative funders, which will create the structure
  needed in order to negotiate the land. &gt; c) the third task will be to raise the
