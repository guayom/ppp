                  refers to the development of a Smart City in an area of 5,600 to
                  7,000 hectares, which will be purchased by a group of developers
                  and investors. The following infrastructure will be developed in
                  a progressive manner:</p><p>1)   <strong> Development of an Industrial
                  & Technological  Park Zone (IPZ)</strong>, in several phases, which
                  includes a mega industrial area for manufacturing and services,
                  a shopping ,distribition and large storage area for Asian products,
                  a technological park which includes an IT,IOT, IDI and Big Data
                  center which could function as a telecom hub in coordination with
                  the USA´s three different time zones and as an attraction of call
                  center operations which currently operate in Southeast Asia; at
                  its premises: a convention center; a stadium with a sports center;
                  a medical hub with a hospital and mixed health services; a school,
                  high school and university centers; housing complexes with options
                  for high income as well as low-income families; shopping centers;
                  country club with golf course; theme park and cable car; entertainment
                  areas, hotels and casinos; government offices; courts of justice,
                  fire and police stations; parks, boulevards, avenues, etc.  All
                  this with an integrated fiber optics Smart communication and operational  system,

                  by 2025 - within an area of 300 hectares.  These lands will be negotiated
                  by the development group, under a public-private alliance scheme
                  with the Government.  Since the land is flat, and the price per
                  meter squared is lower than in other areas being considered for
                  this project, the cost of land movement is also low and there are
                  no aerial obstructions for the landing and takeoff of aircraft.</p><p>3)

                  Cluster</strong>”.  This way, Punta Perla Pacífico will become a
                  high level educational and formative engine in novelty specialty
                  areas such as energy and efficiency, where options for high performance
                  and low environmental impact energy can be developed, and where
                  the use of renewable energies, telematics, medical components ,
                  aerospace technology and robotics, among others, can be optimized.</p><p>A
                  dual education and work program will be put in place to facilitate
                  and  to promote the establishment of new manufacturing and service
                  industries.</p><p>The development  of this Smart City will help
                  decongest the Great Metropolitan Area (GAM and GAMA in Spanish)
                  of traffic, air pollution and housing pressure and restrictions,
                  land prices will also be lower, offering "milenials" , "Z  generation"
                  and future generations of  Costa Ricans as well as foreigners –
                  through the incentives and migratory policies which are already
                  in place through Costa Rica´s Free Trade Agreements with various
                  countries and the aforementioned Pacific Alliance –  could embrace
                  good opportunities for progress and development in an environment
                  free of pollution and traffic facing the beauty of the Pacific Ocean,
                  allowing them to live, work, study and entertain in the coastal
                  area and with a real possibility to own a smart apartment or smart
                  house through integrated financing options with the national banking
                  system.</p><p>With these opportunities, high added-value synergies
                  can be established through the exchange of merchandise across the
                  Panama Canal and with the future Mega Terminal Port in Moin, in
                  the province of Limon on the Caribbean coast, and through a current
                  initiative which proposes to unite both coasts  by a railroad network
                  or "Dry Channel" in the northern part of the country benefitting
                  all the logistics for Costa Rica´s exterior commerce.</p><p>In this
                  way, Punta Perla Pacífico Smart City would be also connected through
                  a new railroad and a modern electric train system to and from the
                  city of San Jose, so people could commute for work or pleasure with
                  a short 45-minute train ride from point to point.</p><p>This ambitious
                  Project would be fully completed within 27 years of its starting
                  date.  For this reason, for this initiative, Pacific Tree S.A. would
                  like to work with the Government of Costa Rica in a private-public
                  Alliance, and would like to invite development companies, development
                  and commercial Banks, and national and international investors to
                  invest in this opportunity, financing the following phase after
                  the Conceptual Plan which has already been completed.  The next
                  phase includes the preliminary study phase, with a DD study, a pre-feasibility
                  financial, social and environmental  study and a pre-master plan
                  in order to go on to advanced study pahse  of a Business Plan, a
                  Master Plan and the Environmental Impact Study, with the objective
                  of getting a Declaratory of National Interest under the Private
                  Initiative Law,and the approval of all  required permits granted
                  by the local and national authorities.</p><h2>2.    Expected results</h2><p>Punta
                  Perla Pacífico Smart City  will be fully planned right from its
                  beginning and will represent an opportunity to develop and alleviate
                  an area of Costa Rica which currently lives in poverty as it has
                  been socioeconomically depressed for many years.  This will be achieved
                  through the establishment of a mutimodal  smart city based on development
                  poles of infrastructure management, commerce, industry, services,
                  education, health, recreation and the following strategic programs:</p><p>a)    Social
                  Investment Program: Public Universities, the National Learning Institute
                  (INA in Spanish), and private Universities, as well as professional
                  technological  and scientific colleges will be invited to take part
                  in this city by having their campuses, under specific development
                  agreements.  For the public sector, we will propose a scheme where
                  the developer supplies the land and infrastructure for such campuses.  There
                  will be an emphasis on the development of highly qualified human
                  capital, and dual education programs at various levels, as a basis
                  for offering the appropriate conditions to those companies who wish
                  to invest and establish their operations and facilities there; as
                  well as attracting already-formed human capital from the Central
                  Valley and  abroad.</p><p>b)    Scientific Development and Transfer
                  Program: There will be a technological center with service and infrastructure
                  facilities to manage (IDI) research, development and innovation
                  in specific relevant areas such as aerospace, atmospheric and climate
                  research, robotics, biology, pharmaceuticals, medicine, fotonics,
                  environment and energy, amongst others.  Where national and international
                  private and public education centers and NGOs can participate in
                  a collaborative way and carry out technological transfers.</p><p>c)    Transportation
                  Program: With the objective of improving public transportation to
                  the Pacific coast and decongesting the Great Metropolitan Area of
                  traffic, parallel to an extension of Route 27 by the current administrator,
                  the possibility of a new railroad network with a modern electric
                  train towards the  south basin of the Virilla River, which implies
                  an improvement of the right of way of the current train route along
                  with improvements to infrastructure, especially new bridges and
                  tunnels.</p><p>d)    Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program:
                  The land where the Project will take place is located in one of
                  Costa Rica´s areas with the most year-round solar radiation; there
                  is large potential for generating electric power through solar energy.  For
                  this reason, there will be a solar photovoltaic park which will
                  interact with the whole development: streets, avenues, houses, buildings,
                  boulevards and parks, among others. Other options for renewable
                  energy such as wind, algae and biomass will also be incorporated
                  in the development.</p><p>e)    Environmental and Social Responsibility
                  Program: Punta Perla Pacífico will contribute to make Costa Rica
                  carbon neutral in the near future, especially because of the mandatory
                  and binding character of the measures which countries need to subscribe
                  to by 2021 in order to reduce carbon emissions, so they can be implemented
                  and monitored systematically.  This initiative will support its
                  inclusion in the OECD and the Pacific Alliance.  The development
                  is conceived as a Smart City right from the start and it will be
                  100% environmentally sustainable.</p><p>f)     Technology and Industry
                  Program: As mentioned above ,the Development of a technological
                  and manufacturing park, will also provide the advantages that the
                  Free Trade Law facilitates, where the appropriate conditions for
                  infrastructure and human capital are created, with lower installation,
                  operation and maintenance costs, fringe benefits reductions and
                  tax incentives,so new industry can settle in and others will move
                  to the Pacific coast.  It includes financing options for housing
                  for the industry workers who will need to leave their houses in
                  the Central Valley to move in this coastal area.</p><p>g)    Residential
                  and Housing Program: Incentives and opportunities to attract younger
                  and future generations to live, study, work and have fun in the
                  Punta Perla Pacífico Smart City, allowing for decongestion of the
                  GAM.  Additionally, we foresee a plan to develop low-cost housing,
                  thus integrating under-priviledged communities into the Smart City
                  through programs of self-building of houses and job creation, in
                  coordination with the appropriate public agencies which are dedicated
                  to social housing, as well as with the Ministry of Labor.</p><p>h)   Tourism
                  Program: A first class Hotel zone will be developed, which will
                  include entertainment and attraction areas, a Theme Park showcasing
                  the culture, art and history of Costa Rica as well as fun ridesand
                  and fuana exhibitions. We are also contemplating a plan to manage,
                  maintain and preserve the mangroves as a low-impact tourist attraction
                  and to visit by ferry boat the city of Puntarenas  and the beuatiful
                  isles of the Gulf of Nicoya. At an advance stage will also be a
                  cable car to and from the Montes de Oro de Miramar Mountains, facing
                  the fabulous view of the Gulf of Nicoya.</p><p>i)     Institutional
                  Program: Facilities for the gradual establishment of public institutions,
                  so they can have  and run their offices there and move some of their
                  operations to the Pacific Coast by having their own buildings, in
                  order to save money by no longer renting offices in the GAM (Great
                  Metro) area.</p><h2>3.    Project Reach at an Infrastructure Level</h2><p>The
                  infrastructure work is foreseen as a systemic integrator which will
                  foster the link between the various population groups and different
                  entities or disciplinary specialties (work areas or economic, administrative
                  or recreational activities).  As such, the idea is to contribute
                  to define area scales (from the regional scale to the neighborhood
                  scale). </p><p>Within the integrating formula of the concept of
                  infrastructure, we must consider the zoning of collective activity
                  areas such as sports centers, schools and universities, administrative
                  buildings, internal collective transportation systems, as well as
                  areas for certain activities and manufacturing. </p><p>In the case
                  of Punta Perla Pacífico Smart City, we must work together with the
                  local authorities (municipalities) to define a Regulatory Zoning
                  Plan (RZP) for the urban development of the Project.</p><p>For this
                  reason, we will determine gradual development phases which will
                  allow for social, environmental and economic planning of the infrastructure.</p><p>From
                  an aeronautical perspective, the privileged location for an international
                  cargo airport to closely work and operate with the IPZ, it will
                  allow the establishment of an urban element which will predominate
                  throughout the whole development; this will generate multiple activities
                  and will demand for a considerable amount of urban infrastructure.
                  </p><p>With the purpose of maintaining the social and cultural link,
                  we believe the recovery and improvement of the existing road network
                  within the lands to be developed is crucial for maintaining a referential
                  urban structure with a historical and cultural background.</p><p>In
                  addition, we will plan for an extension of the current railroad
                  network form San Jose to Puntarenas and vice versa, with the aim
                  of retaining an alternative transportation system which will support
                  the industry,  improve cargo and the transportation of people.</p><p>There
                  are natural barriers, such as rivers, mangroves, wildlife protection
                  areas, existing agro production areas (which will need to stay for
                  a while), and topographical barriers, which will need to be considered
                  in an analysis of costs and opportunities within the initial phases.  </p>'

                  <h2><a id="Introduction_0"></a>Introduction</h2><p><img src="/images/globe.png" alt="Costa Rica" class="pull-right txt-img ">Costa Rica, a small country of 4.6 million residents and 51,100 km2 located in Central America, is gearing up to face the challenges that arise as it becomes a member of the Pacific Alliance through the subscription of regional agreement with Mexico, Chile, Colombia, USA, Panama and Peru. This Alliance shall create synergies among these countries that will lead to becoming chain competitors/partners in order to offer goods and services in the entire Asian-Pacific area and it’s emerging economies (ASIAN). For this, Costa Rica must initiate without delay pro-active initiatives that will substantially improve its infrastructure on all levels: roads, ports, airports, railways, etc.
                  </p><p>This country is a Latin American stronghold with high levels of human development in education and health, with plans that have prospered and been maintained for nearly 50 years.  It now has the great challenge of making long-term decisions that will allow it to generate better and well remunerated jobs, tangible improvements in education and health, maintenance and improvement of its general population welfare levels. The insertion of Costa Rica into the Pacific Alliance will doubtless be one more tool, among others, that will help this small country to steer along the correct route in order to become a developed country within the next 30 years.
                  </p><p>Sub-development can become a permanent condition as well as mediocrity, minds become slow and heavy when a country and its context do not innovate, do not develop and the fundamental changes do not transcend and are not executed due to lack of innovating and developing policies and only those that fit the minds of populist politicians with little vision take place. Progress and development are with-out doubt the mission and vision of this proposal but always hand-in-hand with their social contribution, this being their maximum goal, and of course hand-in-hand with environmental sustainability.
                  </p><p>That is why, Pacific Tree S.A., the conceiver , promoter and coordinating company of the proposal denominated Smart City "Punta Perla Pacifico", wishes to layout its idea and vision which has begun as a dream, but that Costa Rica can bring to life. We oppose and we refuse to think that Costa Rica has to remain in that sub-development lethargy for another 50 years, condemning future generations to a lack of progress opportunities. This being so, Punta Perla Pacífico is precisely about that; it is about promoting a substantial well-planned change with traceable long-term goals.
                  </p><h2><a id="Relevant_Infraestructure_10"></a>Relevant Infraestructure</h2><p><img src="/images/costa-rica-intro.png" alt="Costa Rica" class="pull-right txt-img ">Costa Rica is a country with high indexes of schooling, bilingualism, high-level technical and professional schools in the fields of engineering, medicine, computer science and IT, as well as being considered a tour-ism and ecological destination par excellence in Latin America. The Province of Puntarenas is joined together among other cantons by the three main cantons: Puntarenas  Center, Esparza and Miramar. These include a population of nearly 200,000 residents and this area, rich in lands with a flat topography for agricultural production and its Gulf of Nicoya, once a buoyant fishing zone, for more than 60 years were generators of wealth and employment, activities that no longer allow the needs demanded by the residents to be satisfied. However, it is  an area with an impressive potential, due to its strategic geographical location, its tourism potential without paragon being close to the largest beach of the Pacific and next to a long strip of wetlands and mangroves of exuberant natural beauty with an exit to the sea and towards the lovely islands of the Gulf of Nicoya. It is also located at only 75 kms by road from the capital city of Costa Rica, San Jose, and soon, one and a half hours away to the north to the best tourism area and beaches of the province of Guanacaste.
                  </p><p>Punta Perla Pacífico would be located at the center of those three cantons, within an area that includes the small settlements of Pitaya, Aranjuez and Chomes.  Its strategic location is highlighted since it is also surrounded by the three main ports of the Costa Rican Pacific shore: Caldera which is the grain port, the Cruiser Port of Puntarenas and the Sugar port of Punta Morales at the center of the Americas. Punta Perla Pacífico contemplates the development of a Smart City on a land extension of 5,600 hectares, which can be expanded up to 7,000 hectares.
                  </p><h2><a id="General_Context_16"></a>General Context</h2><p><img src="/images/project-map.png" alt="Costa Rica" class="pull-right txt-img ">The following would be established here: a mega manufacturing indus-trial zone, a trade center of Asian products, a large IT ,IOT and Biga Data center that could operate as a Hub or core telecommunications center, in coordination with the three time zones of the USA and attractive for the telematic and communication operations that American companies operate today in centers in Southeast Asia and India with the disadvantage of the great time table difference with the USA, a convention center, a sports stadium with a sports center, a hospital and health center, school, high-school and university educational centers, residential compounds, shopping centers, a country club with a golf course, a theme park, recreational areas, hotel and casino center, Government offices, Justice Courts, firemen and police force, parks, roundabouts and avenues, etc.   All of this would exist under an integrated compound of “clusters” of smart communication systems in optic fiber, where one will only use self-sustainable transportation and energy support systems, using resources of renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources.
                  </p><p>One would also think about locating a new international cargo airport that Costa Rica needs there, within a 300 hectare area, since these are flat topography lands, at a price per m2 well below those compared with other areas of the country that are currently being studied. Because they are flat lands, the cost of earth movements is low and, what is most important, there are no obstacles for natural approximation and take-off procedures, with the best location from the aeronautical point of view. The new mega port terminal of the Pacific could be located only 15 kms away in a maritime zone with special natural characteristics of draught and depth of 15 meters, where ships with a capacity of up to 12 thou-sand containers of the Panamax and Post Panamax type dimension ships, will be able to dock. With this, high aggregate value synergies would be established for merchandise trade through the Panama Canal and with the future Caribbean terminal port of Moin, of the Province of Limon, with a proposal currently under study that intends to join both coasts through a railway line, benefiting all the processes of the logistic chain of foreign trade of Costa Rica.
                  </p><p>The city Punta Perla Pacífico would be connected through a new railway line and a modern train from and to the city of San Jose, so that the people who work there but do not live there, will be able to go from one place to the other in only 45 minutes. On the other hand, this project intends to decongest and relieve the great vehicle load, pollution issues and the great residential pressure of the Great Metropolitan Area, offering to the younger generations both Costa Rican as well as foreigners, - through incentives and mechanisms of the Immigration policy of Costa Rica, derived from the Free Trade Agreements it has signed with various countries-, the possibility of developing and advancing in a non-polluted environment in contact with the Pacific Ocean, allowing them to live, work ,study and entertain in the coastal zone, and with the real possibility of having their own house through integral financing plans.
                  </p><p>This ambitious project would see its full peak at the end of 27 years.  Pacific Tree S.A., through this initiative-proposal wishes to invite Mega Developers, Development and Commercial Banks and International Investors to invest in this proposal, funding the next stage of our Conceptual Plan, which would be performing a Business Plan and an Environmental Incidence Study, based on a pre-feasibility economic study with the intention that this proposal may be qualified with the Declaration of National Interest and Private Initiative by the Government of Costa Rica.The funds invested in the mentioned studies  towards the construction of public infrastructure  would be reimbursable when the project enters its development stage.
                  </p>
