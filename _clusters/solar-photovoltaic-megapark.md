title: Solar Photovoltaic Megapark
description: "<p><span>The land where this will be located is a sunny place in Costa
  Rica.  Due to this, a solar Photovoltaic Megapark will be developed for the Smart
  City for it to be 100% sustainable;  it is estimated that the solar park will generate
  up to 150MW at its peak within a land  extension between 250-300 hectares.   A tariff
  model for  its sale to the public grid is currently being formulated by the ARESEP
  (the Regulating Authority for Public Services), but it is estimated that it could
  be around US$ 0.08- 0.12 per kWh.  </span></p><p>Initially, it will operate under
  a model of distributed generation, whose over-power generation could be placed within
  the public grid since it so close to the Garabito Thermal Generation and Distribution
  Plant. This cluster will allow Punta Perla Pacífico to contribute so Costa Rica
  can become carbon neutral in the near future by 2020. This initiative will support
  Costa Rica´s joining of the OECD and the Pacific Alliance. </p>"
