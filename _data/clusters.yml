Firstly, as a data support and recovery area, management and analytics of Big Data, and Cloud, as it is located at least 48km away from the capital´s main data centers.  In a second phase, foreign investment will be attracted to offer services to the IT giants taking advantage of a power matrix of clean energy, connectivity and qualified human resources, creating a true technological Hub, under collaboration and articulation with the Inter-university Campus and its study programs.</p>

    For this SEZ development, it is crucial to prepare and train qualified personnel who can work in the area.  For this, we wish to create a University Campus with national and international universities who will share resources and facilities between them. Furthermore, the offer of engineering and scientific careers, so these professionals can contribute to the management of knowledge, innovation and technological transfer required by the SEZ center with adequate facilities to carry out research and development in relevant thematic, through a program that promotes entrepreneurship and dual education in areas such as aerospace, atmospheric and climate research, photonics, robotics, biology, pharmaceutics, medicine, environment and energy, among others.  This way, students of this University, can develop their projects and final papers with companies housed in the SEZ.</p>
